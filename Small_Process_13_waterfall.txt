The image gives information about the erosion process of the Horsehoe Falls in Canada. 
Overall, it is a linear and natural process, entailing four steps: rushing, concentrating, retreating, and forming. 
During the first two steps, the waterfall of the Horseshoe Falls, located in Canada, is initially in the shape of a semicircle, and over the edge a large amount of water flows on when a turbulent flow comes in. Subsequently, the water flow concentrates to the center of the waterfall, where the flow speed is faster than that flowing sideward.  

Following the concentrating process, the edge of the waterfall is eroded, leading the land area where the waterflow flows over to recede. As the cliff line retreats, the semi-circular shape of the waterfall gradually transitions into the shape of a horseshoe.
