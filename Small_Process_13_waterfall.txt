The image gives information about the erosion process of the Horsehoe Falls in Canada. 
Overall, it is a linear and natural process, entailing four steps: rushing, concentrating, retreating and forming. 
During the first two steps, the waterfall the Horseshoe Falls, located in Canada, is initially in a shape of semi-circular, and over the edge a large amount of water flows on when a turbulent flow comes in. Subsequently, the water flow concentrates to the central of the waterfall, where the flow speed is faster than those flow sideward.  

Following the concentrating process, the edge of the waterfall is erosed, leading the land area where the waterflow runs on moving backtoward. As the terrestorial area moves backward, the shape of the waterfall of semi-circular gradually transitions into the shape of a horseshoe.
