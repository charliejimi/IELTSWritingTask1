The images give information about the method to the reproduction of cement and the linear process of concrete manufacturing. 

Overall, the approach to the re-creation of cement is a 6-stage cyclic process; it involves extraction, grinding, the making of cement into concrete, the demolition of the concrete, waste treatment, and the converting of the waste to cement material. The production of concrete is a 4-step, linear and man-made process starting with measuring and mixing, undergoing the steps of transporting and placement, and ending with curing.
 
The extraction of the raw materials, “Limestone” and “Clay”, is implemented, serving as the initial stage of cement production; thereafter, they are mixed to form clinker before it is grinded with Gypsum to produce cement. Cement is subsequently fed into a huge bin to make concrete, which is for the use of constructing. When an old construction is demolished, aggregate is retrieved to make new concrete. During the producing process of new concrete, the “decarbonization” waste treatment is applied. The associated outputs, “Cement Kiln Feed”, “Calcined Clay”,  and the alternate Kiln fuels  are added into the raw materials in the extraction stage to re-create cement. 

Unlike the production of cement, which is a circular process, the manufacture of concrete begins with the mixing of cement, sand and gravel, where there is a specific combination rate. After that, the mixture is blended with water and sand, and transported from a plant to a formwork site by a truck. After the placement stage at the formwork site, the mixture experiences the hydration process and strength inside is built up and concrete is produced.
