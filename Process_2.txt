The images give information about the production and recycling method of cement and the linear process of concrete manufacturing. 
Overall, the approach to the re-creation of cement is a cyclic process, entailing 6 stages: extraction, grinding, the making of concrete as well as its material re-creation, waste treatment, and cement material re-generation. The production of concrete is a 4-step, linear and man-made process. It starts with measuring and mixing, undergoing the steps of transporting and placement, and ending with curing.
 
In the first stage of cement development, the extraction of limestone and clay is implemented. Thereafter, they are mixed to form clinker before it is ground with Gypsum to produce cement. It is subsequently fed into a huge bin to make concrete, which is used for construction. When an old building is demolished, aggregate is retrieved to make new concrete. During its production process , the decarbonization waste treatment is applied. The associated results of cement kiln feed, calcined clay,  and the alternate kiln fuels  are retrieved for new cement creation. 

Unlike the production of cement, the manufacturing of concrete is a sequential process. It begins with the mixing of cement, sand and gravel in a specific combination rate. After that, the mixture is delivered by truck  to a formwork site for placement. It is blended with water and sand during the delivery. Following the placement stage , the mixture undergoes hydration, resulting in the formation of concrete as internal strength is gradually developed.
