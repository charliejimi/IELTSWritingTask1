The images give information about the method of the production and recycling of cement and the linear process of concrete manufacturing. 

Overall, the approach to the development of cement is a 6-stage cyclic process. It involves extraction, grinding, the making of concrete, as well as its material re-creation, waste treatment, and cement material re-generation. The production of concrete is a 4-step, linear and man-made process starting with measuring and mixing, passing through the transporting and placement steps, and ending with curing.
 
Regarding the cement process, the extraction of the raw materials, limestone and clay, is implemented, serving as the initial stage of cement production; thereafter, they are mixed to form clinker before it is ground with Gypsum to produce cement. It is subsequently fed into a huge bin to make concrete, which is used for construction. When an old building is demolished, aggregate is retrieved to make new concrete. During its production process, the decarbonization waste treatment is applied and the associated results of cement kiln feed, calcined clay,  and the alternate kiln fuels, are used as the cement raw materials for its re-creation. 

Unlike the production of cement, which is a circular process, the manufacturing of concrete, a sequential process, begins with the mixing of cement, sand and gravel, where there is a specific combination proportion. After that, the mixture is blended with water and sand, and transported from a plant to a formwork site by a truck. After the placement stage at the formwork site, the mixture experiences the hydration process, and concrete is formed while internal strength is constructed.
