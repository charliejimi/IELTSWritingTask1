The images give information about the method to the reproduction of cement and the linear process of concrete manufacturing. 

Overall, the approach to the re-creation of cement is a 6-stage cyclic process; it involves extraction, grinding, the making of concrete and its material re-creating, waste treatment, and cement material re-generating. The production of concrete is a 4-step, linear and man-made process starting with measuring and mixing, passing through the transporting and placement steps, and ending with curing.
 
The extraction of the raw materials, “Limestone” and “Clay”, is implemented, serving as the initial stage of cement production; thereafter, they are mixed to form clinker before it is ground with Gypsum to produce cement. It is subsequently fed into a huge bin to make concrete, which is for the use of constructing. When an old construction is demolished, aggregate is retrieved to make new concrete. During its producing process, the “decarbonization” waste treatment is applied and the associated outputs Cement Kiln Feed, Calcined Clay,  and the alternate Kiln fuels are added to the cement raw materials to re-create it. 

Unlike the production of cement, which is a circular process, the manufacture of concrete begins with the mixing of cement, sand and gravel, where there is a specific combination proportion. After that, the mixture is blended with water and sand, and transported from a plant to a formwork site by a truck. After the placement stage at the formwork site, the mixture experiences the hydration process; concrete is produced while internal strength is constructed.
