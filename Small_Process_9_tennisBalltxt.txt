The image illustrates the manufacturing process of tennis balls. 

Overall, producing tennis balls is a linear, man-made, nine-step process. 
It commences with mixing, molding, the application of adhesive, fusing, cutting, coating, wrapping, then culminates in the final product. 

During the initial four steps, the raw materials, raw rubber polymers and chemical additives, are mixed together, with an external heat being applied as they are being blended. Subsequently, the mixture is poured into a mold to form hollow hemispherical shells, followed by the application of adhesive to the rims of the shells. Once the application step is done, the shells are placed into a machine which fuses the shells together while pressurized gas is injected into the machince. 

Following the fusing step, the raw material of the shells cover, synthetic felt sheets, is cut into dumbbell shapes and sprayed with adhesive by a coating, binding agent. Upon the felt pieces are made, the shells are mechianically wrapped with these covers and the resultant is conveyed into a pressurized containers to be steamed to meet a good quailty. After that, the final product, tennis balls, are inspected and packaged to be delivered.
