The image illustrates the manufacturing process of tennis balls. 

Overall, producing tennis balls is a linear, man-made, nine-step process. 
It commences with mixing, molding, the applying of an adhesive, fusing, cutting, coating, wrapping, then culminates in the inspection and packaging of the final product. 

During the initial four steps, the raw materials, raw rubber polymers and chemical additives, are mixed together, with an external heat being applied as they are being blended. Subsequently, the mixture is poured into a mold to form hollow hemispherical shells, followed by the implementation of applying 
an adhesive to the rims of the shells. Upon the applying step is done, the shells are placed into a machine which fuses the shells together while pressurized gas is injected into the machince. 

Following the fusing step, the covers of the shells are made, where the raw material, synthetic felt sheets, is cut into the shape of a dumbbell, and an adhesive is sprayed on their surface by a coating, binding agent. Once the felt pieces are produced, the shells are wrapped with these covers mechanically, and the resultant is conveyed into a pressurized containers to be steamed. Afterwards, the inspection of the final product, tennis balls, is implemented; upon the completion of this step, they are packaged for delivery.
