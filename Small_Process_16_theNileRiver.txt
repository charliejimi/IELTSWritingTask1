The image gives information about the convergeing of the Blue Nile and the White Nile into the main river system. 
Overall, it is the natural, linear process, entailing 4 steps: origination, convergence, formation, and the emptying of the main stream into the sea northern to Egypt. 
Initially, the White Nile originates from the eastern part of Africa, flowing steadily, while the Blue Nile originates from the Lake Tana in Ethiopia, bringing a large volume of water and seidment to the main stream. Upon flowing to Khartoum of Sudan, these two streams converge and therefore form the Main Nile. The converged stream flows northwards, navigating through the desert in Egypt, where this movement of the stream results in the formation of a single main channel. Following this, the stream continues to flow nothwards and empties into the Mediterranean Sea, northern part to Egypt.
