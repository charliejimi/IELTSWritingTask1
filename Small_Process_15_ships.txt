The image depicts the management of the transition of ships through the Suze Canal's narrow section. 
Overall, managing the ship to pass through the canal's narrow section is a linear, man-made process, involving 3 steps: entering, waiting, and passing. 
Initially, a ship enters to the Suze Canal; once it approaches the entrance of the narrow part of the waterway, which accommodates only one ship to cross this part, the ship waits for another ship to pass through first. This clearization of the narrow section of the waterway maintains the traffic flow clear. 
Upon the ship fully passing through, the wating ship in turn traverses the cannal's narrow part.
