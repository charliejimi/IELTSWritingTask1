The image depicts the management of the transition of ships through the Suze Canal's narrow section. 
Overall, managing the ship to pass through the canal's narrow section is a linear, man-made process, involving 3 steps: entering, waiting, and passing. 
Initially, a ship enters to the Suze Canal; once it approaches the entrance of the narrow part that accommodates only one ship, the ship waits for another ship to pass through first. This clearization of the narrow section maintains the traffic flow clear. 
Upon the ship fully passing through, the wating ship in turn traverses the cannal's narrow part.
