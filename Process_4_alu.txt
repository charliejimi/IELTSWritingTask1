The images give information about the six major steps in the recycle process of aluminum cans. 

Overall, the recycling of aluminum cans is a linear, artificial process, entailing six stages: collcetion, filtering and washing, 
pulverization, melting, the formation of cans' shaps, and the production of new cans. 

Before the melting stage, the disposals of aluminum cans are collected and delivered by trucks to a factory for re-development. The source is filtered out from those collections and then cleaned; non-useful iron-made collected items are picked out by a megnetic-property-check machine. Subsequently, the aluminum source is passed through a machine and pulverized into fine particles.  

In contrast to the source retrieval of alumimun cans, high temperature is required to melt the source. Those particle-shapped source is sent to a heater and heated to a certain degree to convert it into liquid. It is poured out at a high temperature and rolls around the surface of can-like containers, which forms alumimun cans as their temperature gradually cools down. When the shaps of alumimun cans are formed, they are taken out from the containers and placed on a rolling track for selling.
