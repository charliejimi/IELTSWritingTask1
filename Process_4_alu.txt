The images give/provide information about the six major steps in the recycling process of aluminium cans.

Overall, the recycling of aluminium cans is a linear, artificial process. It entails six stages: collection, filtering and washing, pulverization, melting, shape forming(shaping), and the production of new cans.

During the initial three stages of the recycling process, unused aluminium cans are collected and delivered by trucks to a factory for reprocessing. Before the sub-stage of washing (the washing stage), the source is filtered out from these collections as non-reusable iron items are separated by a magnetic separator. Subsequently, the aluminium source is passed through a machine and pulverized into fine particles.

Following pulverization, those fine particles are sent to a heater to be melted down, after which the liquid is poured into molds. This results in the formation of aluminium cans as their temperature gradually cools down. Once aluminium cans are formed, they are taken out of the molds and placed on a rolling track for shipment.
