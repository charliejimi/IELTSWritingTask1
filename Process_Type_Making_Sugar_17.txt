The diagram illustrates the process by which sugar is produced, showing the various steps involved from the raw material to the final end-product. 

Overall, the process consists of a linear sequence of seven engineered stages: growing, harvesting, crushing, purifying, evaporating, separating, and the last combined step of drying and cooling. 


In the first stage, the raw material of sugar canes undergoes the growth of 12-18 months, which is subsequently harvested by farmers manually or with a specialized machine. The harvested sugar canes are fed into an apparatus to be crushed into juice. Once the processed material takes the form of juice, the purification of this substance is conducted, during which it undergoes the removal of unwanted elements.


Following this, the processed substance passes through multiple stages: it is loaded into a specialized vessel and subjected to heat application, and becomes syrup; this is then transferred into a centrifuge to separate sugar crystals from the syrup. Afterwards, the resulting outcome is loaded into a container for drying and cooling. At this point, the completed product takes its appropriate form once the final process step  is finalized, marking the completion of the process.
