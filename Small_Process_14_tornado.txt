The image depicts the process of the tornado's formation and its life cycle. 

Overall, it is a natural process and entails a sequence of 6-stages. It involves the development of a storm, the making of the wind shear, the formation of a mesocyclone, followed by the forming of a funnel cloud, which then becomes a destructive tornado, and the process culminates in the tornado's  dissipation.

During the initial three stages, the air of a cold dry and a warm moist one moves down and up, and it gradually becomes instable, resulting in the development of a storm. Once the instability of the air has become critical, during which the mixture of two sorts of the air rotates horizontally, the wind shear is formed within the storm.  Upwards from the ground, a strong updraft flows into the storm, which therefore transitions into a mesocyclone, followed by the creation of a funnel cloud.  

At the stage of the formation of the funnel cloud, the air descends when its pressure increased at the lower part, which makes the clould heavier. Subsequently, when the funnel cloud touches the ground, the tornado is formed, destructs properties on the ground, and dissipates as long as the cold air flows into the tornado.
