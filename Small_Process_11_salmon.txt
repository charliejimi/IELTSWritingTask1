The image dipicts the circular process of the Pacific salmon's life. 

Overall, it is a natural, cyclic, 5-step process; it begins with the incubation of eggs, the growth of a fry, the development of a smolt and then an adult salmon, culminating in a spawning salmon, which repeats continuously. 

During the initial three stages, the eggs undergo the incubation of 1-5 months, after that they develop into alevins with yolk scas. Subsequently, the alevins grow into fries with distinctive vertical strips on their bodies for camouflage, diet aquatic insects, and mainly habitat in freshwater, which last 1-3 years. Afterwards, they migrate downstream to an estuary and develop into smolts, during which they lose the vertical strips while developing silvery skins. 

Following the development of an adult salmon, they become mature and signifcantly lager, with their bodies being fully silver, and they live in the sea and diet krill, squid, and forge fish. This period lasts 1-4 years, after which they develop into spawning salmons, and return to a natural  stream to prepare laying eggs. Upon completion of laying eggs, they die and the process continuously repeat. 	(40 mins)
