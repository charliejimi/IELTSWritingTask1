The image dipicts the circular process of the Pacific salmon's life. 

Overall, it is a natural, cyclic, 5-step process; it begins with the incubation of eggs, the growth of a fry, the development of a smolt and then an adult salmon, culminating in a spawning salmon, which repeats continuously. 

During the initial three stages, the eggs undergo the incubation of 1-5 months, after that they develop into alevins with yolk sacs. Subsequently, the alevins grow into fries with distinctive vertical stripes on their bodies for camouflage, eat aquatic insects, and mainly dwell in freshwater, which last 1-3 years. Afterwards, they migrate downstream to an estuary and develop into smolts, during which they lose the vertical stripes while developing silvery skins. 

Following the development of an adult salmon, they become mature and significantly lager, with their bodies being fully silver, and they live in the sea and feed on krills, squids, and forage fish. This period lasts 1-4 years, after which they develop into spawning salmon and return to a natural stream to prepare for laying eggs. Upon completion of laying eggs, they die and the life cycle repeats on and on. 	(40 mins)
