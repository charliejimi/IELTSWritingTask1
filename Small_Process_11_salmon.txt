The image depicts the circular process of the Pacific salmon's life. 

Overall, it is a natural, cyclic, 5-step process; it begins with the incubation of eggs, the growth of a fry, the development of a smolt and then an adult salmon, culminating in a spawning salmon, which repeats continuously. 

During the initial three stages, the eggs undergo the incubation of 1-5 months, after that they transition into alevins with yolk sacs. Subsequently, the alevins grow into fries with distinctive vertical stripes on their bodies for camouflage, eat aquatic insects, and mainly dwell in freshwater, which lasts 1-3 years. Afterwards, they migrate downstream to an estuary and smoltify into ocean-ready smolts, during which they lose the vertical stripes while developing silvery skins. 

Following the development of fully grown fish, they become mature and significantly larger, with their bodies being fully silver, from this they live in the sea and feed on krill, squid, and forage fish. This period spans 1-4 years, after which they home to spawn. Upon completion of laying eggs, they die and the cycle perpetually continues. 	(40 mins)
