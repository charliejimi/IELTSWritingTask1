The diagram provides information about the manufacturing process of a motorcycle. 

Overall, the manufacturing process of a scooter is a linear, man-made, five-step process. It begins with fabricating, finishing, the assembly of components, fitting, and culminating in the quality inspection and the product distribution.

Initially, the raw materials consisting of steel coils, plastic polymers, electronic wiring, engines, and auxiliary materials are retrieved and the steel coils are used to fabricate the chassis of a scooter. During this step, the material is transferred to a mold to form the chassis of a scooter, followed by a welding process which is done by robotic hands. Subsequently, the chassis is painted and conveyed to a dryer to ensure its structure is rust-proof; meanwhile, the seat of a motorcycle is manufactured. Once the core components have been produced, they are mounted with an engine and tires, and all of the parts are wired together.

Following the assembly of the motorcycle, the auxiliary materials such as the front mirrors and back lights are put on the scooter to be calibrated. Afterwards, the motorcycle is placed on a conveyor for a final inspection and then is ready to be distributed to markets.
