The images illustrate two distinct processes involved in making cement and concrete.

Overall, the production of cement involves numerous stages; it is a linear, man-made process, starting with the crushing of raw materials, followed by the steps of mixing and heating, ending with the packing of the product. The producing of concrete is a single-step process, where the cement, along with three other materials, is blended in a rotating bin to form the end product.

Regarding cement production, the raw materials clay and limestone are pulverized by a crusher, then sent into a mixer for thorough mixing.   After that, the mixture is conveyed through a rotating heater, with heat being applied externally.  Then the heated mixture is fed through a grinder where  it is ground into a fine powder, which is ultimately packaged into bags.

Looking at concrete production, it involves the combining of four ingredients together, with half of the mixture being composed of sand, a quarter of gravel, and 15% and 10% of cement and water, respectively. These four materials are then rotated clockwise in a concrete mixer until the final product is formed.
