The images illustrate two distinct processes involved in making cement and concrete.

Overall, the manufacturing of cement is a five-step linear process. It begins with crushing limestone and clay; it is then mixed, heated,  ground, and  packaged into bags. Producing concrete is a simple mixing process, where the cement, along with three other materials, is combined to be formed into an end product. 

Regarding cement production, the raw materials clay and limestone are pulverized by a crusher, and the powder is sent into a mixer for thorough mixing. The mixture is conveyed through a rotating heater, with heat being applied externally.  It is fed through a grinder where  it is ground into a fine powder, which is ultimately packed into bags.

Unlike the procedure for making cement, which is complicated, manufacturing concrete involves combining four ingredients; the combination is composed of half sand, a quarter of gravel, and 15% and 10% of cement and water, respectively. These four materials are thereafter rotated clockwise in a concrete mixer until the final product is produced.
