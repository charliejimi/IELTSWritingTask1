The images illustrate two distinct processes involved in making cement and concrete.

Overall, the manufacturing of cement is a five-step linear process. It begins with crushing limestone and clay; it is then mixed, heated,  ground, and  packaged into bags. Producing concrete is a simple mixing process, where the cement, along with three other materials, is combined to form concrete. 

Regarding cement production, the raw materials clay and limestone are pulverized by a crusher, then sent into a mixer for thorough mixing.   After that, the mixture is conveyed through a rotating heater, with heat being applied externally.  Then the heated mixture is fed through a grinder where  it is ground into a fine powder, which is ultimately packaged into bags.

Looking at concrete production, it involves the combining of four ingredients together, with half of the mixture being composed of sand, a quarter of gravel, and 15% and 10% of cement and water, respectively. These four materials are then rotated clockwise in a concrete mixer until the final product is formed.
