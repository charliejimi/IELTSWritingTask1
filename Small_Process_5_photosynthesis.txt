This diagram illustrates the interaction cycle between vegetation and the atmosphere. 

Overall, the interaction is a cyclic, 4-stage process, beginning with absorbing, converting, releasing, and culminating with respiration, which repeats continuously. 

During the initial two stages, green plants absorb solar energy, serving as the input for photosynthesis. Meanwhile, they take in carbon dioxide  and convert it into carbohydrates by utilizing solar energy, which leads to their growth and biomass accumulation. 

Following the intake of carbon dioxide, they release oxygen to the air for human respiration. After having consumed oxygen, the human generates carbon dioxide and feed it back to the atmosphere for green plants to take in, forming a continuous cyclical flow.
