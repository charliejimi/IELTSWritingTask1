The image gives information about the processes of traffic flow, alongside the drainage and utility supply flow systems, in an urban city.

Overall, the traffic flow is a three-state, sequential process, beginning with parking and moving, then culminating in the arrival at destination points. The drainage and utility supply systems are both linear, multiple-step processes. The drainage system starts with channelling and ends with discharging; the utility system begins with transmission and culminates in heat release.

Focusing specifically on the traffic flow process,  vehicles and scooters are  in a parked state prior to entering the city, after which they commence movement within the road network. Afterwards, they are conveyed to the destination points, buildings and parking areas; then goods and people are transported to other nodes of the city.

Turning to the drainage flow system, this linear process starts with the step that rainwater is channelled through the pipes of houses to the ground, where the rainfall is gathered. Simultaneously, some of the rainfall is fed into the underground pipe network via gutters and discharged to the sea. Looking into the utility supply system, it commences with the supply of  energy from a power station, which is subsequently transmitted over electric transmission lines and  distributed to individuals' houses. From this, the electric power is applied to the appliances in those houses and the heat produced by these appliances is released into the outside of the houses.
