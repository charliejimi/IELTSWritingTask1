The image dipicts the human's sleep cycle. 

Overall, it is a cyclical progression and entails five stages: light, deep, deeper, deepest, REM sleeping stages.

During the initial stages, the human's muscle loosens up, with heart rate slowing down and brain activity decreasing as they begin to fall asleep. Subsequently, their body's temperature drops, and the movement of their eyes stops once the sleeping stage moves to a deeper degree; meanwhile, the brain produces sleep spindles. Upon completion of the production of sleep spindles, the brain manufactures delta waves, preventing waking up easily, which leads to the brain to enter into restorative sleep. 

Following the stage of restorative sleep, the human reaches the deepest stage, druing which the human's body repairs automatically and they are difficult to wake up. From this, their brain starts to occur with dreaming, its activity increases and the body is temporarily paralized with their eyes moving rapidly, which perpetually continues the next day.
