The image depicts the human's sleep cycle. 

Overall, it is a cyclical progression and entails four stages: light, deep, deeper, and deepest.

During the initial three stages, the human's muscles loosen up, with heart rate slowing down and brain activity decreasing as they begin to feel drowsy. Subsequently, their bodies' temperature drops, and the movement of their eyes stops once the sleeping state moves to a deeper degree; meanwhile, sleep spindles are produced by humans' brains. Upon completion of the production of sleep spindles, delta waves are manufactured by the brains, preventing waking up easily, which leads to the brains entering restorative sleep. 

At the stage of restorative sleep, their brains reach the deepest sleep stage, during which their physical condition is automatically restored and they become hard to wake up. Following this, the brains commence to generate dreams alongside an increase in brain activity, the bodies are temporarily paralyzed with their eyes moving rapidly, and this whole cycle recurs each night.
