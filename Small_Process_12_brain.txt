The image depicts the human's sleep cycle. 

Overall, it is a cyclical progression and entails five stages: light, deep, deeper, deepest, REM sleeping stages.

During the initial three stages, the human's muscles loosen up, with heart rate slowing down and brain activity decreasing as they begin to fall asleep. Subsequently, their bodies' temperature drops, and the movement of their eyes stops once the sleeping stage moves to a deeper degree; meanwhile, humans' brains produce sleep spindles. Upon completion of the production of sleep spindles, the brains manufacture delta waves, preventing waking up easily, which leads to the brains entering restorative sleep. 

At the stage of restorative sleep, the human reaches the deepest stage, during which the human's body repairs automatically and they are difficult to wake up. From this, their brains start to dream, brain activity increases and the bodies are temporarily paralyzed with their eyes moving rapidly, and this cycle perpetually continues the next day.
