The images give information about the life process of a/the silkworm and the production of silk cloth. 
Overall, the life of silkworm is a cyclic process, entailing four stages: the birth of a silkworm, the larva growth, the making of silk thread, the formation of a cocoon, and the development of the moth to lay eggs for new silkworms. The manufacture of silk cloth is a linear, man-made, five-step process, starting from selecting a cocoon (the selection of a cocoon), boiling, unwinding, twisting, and ending with weaving. 

Regarding the silkworm life cycle, it lays eggs, and silkworm larvas come out after 10 days. The larvas eat
mulberry leaves while growing up, which lasts 4-6 weeks. Following the status, they start to make silk thread, winding themselves with their silk. 
It results the formation of a cocoon as they are entirely encircled by the silk thread. After 16 days, they become a moth inside the cocoon and break it to lay  eggs for the next generation. 

Unlike the circular process of the life of a silkworm, the manufacture of silk cloth is a sequential process. 
It begins with the selection of cocoon, and the selected ones are fed into/soaked in water to later be boiled.  
Once they become soft in the boiling water, they are retrieved from it and unwound into threads of 300 to 900 meters long. 
The threads are subsequently twisted and dyed with colors. Following the twisting stage, they are weaved and dyed as well,
resulting in the formation of silk cloth as the surface color gradually dries.
