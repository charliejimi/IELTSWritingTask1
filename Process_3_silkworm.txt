The images give information about the life process of silkworm and the production of silk cloth. 
Overall, the life of silkworm is a cyclic process, entailing four stages: the birth of silkworm, the larva growth, the making of silk thread, the cocoon formation, 
the becoming of moth to lie eggs for new silkworm. The manufacture of silk cloth is a linear, man-made, five-steps process, starting from
selecting, passing through the steps of boiling, unwinding as well as twisting, and ending with weaving. 
Regarding the silkworm life cycle, it lies eggs and silkworm larvas come out after 10 days. The larvas eat
mulberry leaf while growing up, which lasts 4-6 weeks. Following the status, they start to make silk thread; meanwhile, they are winded by their silk. 
It results the formation of cocoon as they are entirely encircled by the silk thread. After 16 days, they become moth inside the cocoon and break it to lie new eggs for its next generation. 

Unlike the generation continuity process of silkworm, the manufacture of silk cloth is a sequential process. 
It begins with the selection of cocoon, and the selected ones are fed into water to be boiled.  
Upon becoming soft in boiling water, they are retrieved from it and unwinded into threads of 300 to 900 meters long. 
The threads are subsequently twisted and dyed with colors. Following the twisting stage, they are weaved and dyed as well,
resulting the formation of silk cloth as the color on its surface was gradually dried.
