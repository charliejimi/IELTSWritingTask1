The images give information about the life process of silkworms and the production of silk cloth. 
Overall, the life of silkworm is a cyclic process, entailing five stages: the birth of silkworms, the growth of larvae, the spinning of silk thread, the formation of cocoons, the development of moths to lay eggs for new silkworms. The manufacture of silk cloth is a linear, artificial, five-step process, starting from the selection of cocoons, boiling, unwinding, twisting, and ending with weaving. 
During the silkworms' life cycle, they lay eggs and the silkworm larvae come out after 10 days. The larvae eat
mulberry leaves while growing up, which lasts 4-6 weeks. Following the stages, they start to make silk thread; meanwhile, they are wound with their silk. 
It results in the formation of cocoons as the silk threads surround them entirely. After 16 days, they become moths inside the cocoon and break it to lay eggs for their next generation. 

In contrast to the life cycle of silkworms, the manufacture of silk cloth is a sequential process. 
It begins with the selection of cocoons, and the selected ones are fed into water to be boiled.  
Upon becoming soft in boiling water, they are retrieved from it and unwound into threads of 300 to 900 meters long. 
The threads are subsequently twisted and dyed with colors. Following the twisting stage, they are woven and dyed as well,
resulting in the formation of silk cloth as the color on its surface gradually dries.
