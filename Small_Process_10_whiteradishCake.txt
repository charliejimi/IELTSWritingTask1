The image depicts the manufacturing process of white radish cakes. 

Overall, the production of white radish cakes is a linear, artificial, 5-step process. It begins with dicing, grating, squeezing, and mixing; it then culminates in cooking. 
 
During the initial three steps, the raw material, white radishes, having been washed, is peeled and cut into dice, which is subsequently placed into a container to be grated. Once the diced white radishes are grated into shreds, the step of dehydration is conducted, during which these shreds are manually squeezed to extract water. 

Following the dehydration step, another raw material for white radish cakes, consisting of rice batter, is mixed with the squeezed shreds and the mixture has seasonings added to it during mixing. Upon completion of the mixing step, the resultant mixture is poured into a container to be molded and steamed, resulting in white radish cakes as soon as the steaming is finallized.
