The image depicts the manufacturing process of white radish cakes. 

Overall, the production of white radish cakes is a linear, artificial, 5-step process. It begins with dicing, grating, squeezing, and mixing; it then culminates in cooking. 
 
During the initial three steps, the raw material, white radishes, having been washed, is peeled and cut into dices, which are subsequently placed into a container to be grated. Once the white radishes in the shap of dices are grated into silks, the step of dehydration is conducted, where these silks are squeezed by hands to extract water. 

Following the dehydration step, another raw material for white radish cakes, consisting of rice batter, is mixed with the squeezed silks and the mixture is added with seasonings during the mixing step. Upon completion of the mixing step, the resulting mixture is poured into a container to be molded and steamed, which leads to the formation of white radish cakes as soon as the steaming step has been done.
